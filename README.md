# Use SharePoint as share folder in your Windows computer.

If you like SharePoint, then you probably love to use it as a share drive on your Windows computer.

No user guide, nothing.  If you still using Windows 7 then try to install Powershell 5.1 before use it.  Also suggest to compile the script to exe with ps2exe.ps1
Just try and let me know if you are facing any trouble.
